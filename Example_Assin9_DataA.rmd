Grad school addmissions. This is a binary outcome (TRUE/FALSE) so we will use logistic regression
to predict grad school admission success.


```{r,echo=FALSE}

head(df)
df$admit <- as.logical(df$admit)


mod <- glm(df, 
           formula = admit ~ gre + gpa + rank,
           family = "binomial")

add_predictions(df, mod, type = "response")%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=gpa, y=pred, color = factor(rank)))+
  geom_smooth()

```
